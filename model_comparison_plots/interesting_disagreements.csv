"dr goffe is a chill guy. hardest issue is paying attention as he has a very soft voice and a low mic volume it makes it hard to pay attention. his notes are also not very direct and relate to real world events, therefore on occasion can be hard to understand a fine cut definition. overall it was a fine class but the gsg sessions helped more.

she is amazing! she gives lecture notes and study guides to help you succeed. she is super funny and makes the content interesting! she is super easy to connect with; her and the ta's will help you anytime you need them. she offers extra credit which is a nice grade booster. i absolutely recommend her if you have to take an intro psych class! ,2,positive,2,positive,0,negative,3,True,Psychology,False,True,False,True,False,False
i thought dr. pearson was great! if you come to class and genuinely listen to what he has to say and read the textbook you will do great on exams. he is very old schooled kind of a professor in a way of just takes notes and read textbook. he has very enjoyable lectures and i think it was a pretty laid back class. no homework either ,2,positive,2,positive,0,negative,3,True,Psychology,False,True,False,True,False,False

"boyle gives a lot of room to boost your grade through homework which is nice and a group portion on the exams. i will still say this is the hardest class i have taken and the avg on exams were all 60s. he is not a great teacher though, lectures do not teach you anything and you need to have a very strong statistics background.

bill is a great guy and super friendly. he is also very helpful too and wants everyone to do well. there are bi-weekly quizzes in pollock which mostly make up your grade. there are also assignments on perusall and canvas. definitely watch the gsgs because those were extremely helpful for each quiz. instead of tophat he uses iclicker. ,2,positive,2,positive,0,negative,3,True,Economics,False,True,False,True,False,False
