bill is a great guy and super friendly. he is also very helpful too and wants everyone to do well. there are bi-weekly quizzes in pollock which mostly make up your grade. there are also assignments on perusall and canvas. definitely watch the gsgs because those were extremely helpful for each quiz. instead of tophat he uses iclicker. ,2,positive,2,positive,0,negative,3,True,Economics,False,True,False
"boyle gives a lot of room to boost your grade through homework which is nice and a group portion on the exams. i will still say this is the hardest class i have taken and the avg on exams were all 60s. he is not a great teacher though, lectures do not teach you anything and you need to have a very strong statistics background.

"please do not take this class with him. the content is a lot but he makes it impossible to understand. his tests are nothing like his lectures, which are useless as he talks without saying much. over that he made us buy a textbook that he created for one question in our first hw and never again. the tas are the only reason anything gets done.

she appears to be the lesser of a few evils when it comes to this vs stat 200. probably should take her as its online but she does next to nothing to actually teach. she's tenured and doesn't care lol. lock in like 2-3 days before each exam and make yourself a solid review sheet to use for the exams (open note) and it'll be manageable ,0,negative,2,positive,0,negative,3,,Business,False,False,True

great professor who was funny and shared personal stories that connected with class. the lectures were really interesting but could get long (often got out early tho). there was a good amount of reading outside of class plus having to participate in sona research. lots of extra credit though and exams were online and open-note. would take again! ,2,positive,2,positive,0,negative,3,True,Psychology,False,True,False

dr. pearson is a very nice guy and understanding. overall 10/10 guy. but he is exam heavy and they are very challenging even if you study a ton. you also have to read the textbook since he uses it on his exams. there is little room to improve your grade since he only does exams and a word of the day grade (which don't do much for your grade). ,1,neutral,2,positive,0,negative,5,,Psychology,False,False,False
"dr goffe is a chill guy. hardest issue is paying attention as he has a very soft voice and a low mic volume it makes it hard to pay attention. his notes are also not very direct and relate to real world events, therefore on occasion can be hard to understand a fine cut definition. overall it was a fine class but the gsg sessions helped more.

i thought dr. pearson was great! if you come to class and genuinely listen to what he has to say and read the textbook you will do great on exams. he is very old schooled kind of a professor in a way of just takes notes and read textbook. he has very enjoyable lectures and i think it was a pretty laid back class. no homework either ,2,positive,2,positive,0,negative,3,True,Psychology,False,True,False
